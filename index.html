						<h2>Why waste? We will collect....</h2>
						<p>The environmental and social benefits of reuse do not only help conserve natural resources, but help reduce air and water pollution caused by hazardous disposal. Reuse reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emmissions caused by the manufacturing of new products. It simply makes good sense to let us collect and reuse your equipment</p>
